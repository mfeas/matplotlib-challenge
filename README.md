Module Five challenge

For module five the challenge was to take the data from Pymaceucticals cancer medicine studies on test subject mice and create a data story. Using the knowledge from class to create my data frames and clean the data I was able to create the visuals needed to showcase the results. I used stack overflow, the class slides, bing AI, matplotlib.org and geeksforgeeks to write my code and recreate the examples provided following the starter code. After writing my code I would run it to test my results and then run it through bing AI to see if there were simpler/cleaner ways to write my code. Lastly, I used the visuals and results from the code to write an analysis.
